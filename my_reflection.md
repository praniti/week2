# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
The DOM is basically the basic outline of HTML and CSS and how they are related. It seems convinenet that there is a universal accepted DOM that people follow. Because of this, we can use inspectors like Dev Tools to alter webpages.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
My site had less aspects than a wordpress site.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
I thought they were fun. It was fun to alter websites to make them look how you want them to be. I found this tool pretty intuitive, especially because you could use the inspecter feature on any element.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
Yes. It all started to click after looking at a few various webpages. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
